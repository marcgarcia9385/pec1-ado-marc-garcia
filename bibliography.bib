	abstract="A typical microarray experiment results in series of images, depending on the experimental design and number of samples. Software analyses the images to obtain the intensity at each spot and quantify the expression for each transcript. This is followed by normalization, and then various data analysis techniques are applied on the data. The whole analysis pipeline requires a large number of software to accurately handle the massive amount of data. Fortunately, there are large number of freely available and commercial software to churn the massive amount of data to manageable sets of differentially expressed genes, functions, and pathways. This chapter describes the software and tools which can be used to analyze the gene expression data right from the image analysis to gene list, ontology, and pathways.",

    abstract = {Nutritional intake is a fundamental determinant of health. Many studies have correlated excess caloric intake, as well as a high ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids, with detrimental health outcomes, such as the metabolic syndrome. In contrast, low-calorie diets have beneficial health effects. Despite these associations, our understanding of the causal relationship between diet and health remains largely elusive. The present study examined the molecular changes elicited by nine diets with varying fat, sugar, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and calories in C57BL/6 male mice. Microarray analyses were conducted on liver samples from three mice per diet and detected 20,449 genes of which 3,734 were responsive to changes in dietary components. Principal component analysis showed that diet restriction correlated the least with the other diets and also affected more genes than any other diet. Interestingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified gene sets involved in glutathione metabolism, immune response, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, ABC transporters, and oxidative phosphorylation as being highly responsive to changes in diet composition. On the gene level, this study reveals novel findings such as the induction of the drug efflux pump Abcb1a (p-glycoprotein) by diet restriction and an atherogenic diet, as well as the suppression of the rate limiting step of bile acid synthesis, Cyp7a1, by a high fructose diet. This study provides considerable insight into the molecular changes incurred by a variety of diets and furthers our understanding of the causal relationships between diet and health.},

    abstract = "{Low tissue levels of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6(n-3)], are implicated in postpartum depression. The effects of 1–4 sequential reproductive cycles on maternal brain phospholipid fatty acid composition were determined in female rats fed diets containing α-linolenic acid (ALA), containing ALA and pre-formed DHA (ALA+DHA), or lacking ALA (low-ALA). Virgin females, fed the diets for commensurate durations served as a control for reproduction. Whole-brain total phospholipid composition was determined at weaning by TLC/GC. A single reproductive cycle on the low-ALA diet decreased brain DHA content by 18\\% compared to ALA primiparas (P \\&lt; 0.05), accompanied by incorporation of docosapentaenoic acid ((n-6) DPA, 22:5(n-6)) to 280\\% of ALA primiparas (P \\&lt; 0.05). DHA was not further decreased after subsequent cycles; however, there was an additional increase in (n-6) DPA after the second cycle (P \\&lt; 0.05). Brain DHA of virgin females fed the low-ALA diet for 27 wk decreased 15\\% (P \\&lt; 0.05), but was accompanied by a more modest increase in (n-6) DPA than in parous low-ALA dams (P \\&lt; 0.05). Virgin females and parous dams fed the diet containing ALA+DHA exhibited only minor changes in brain fatty acid composition. These observations demonstrate that brain DHA content of adult animals is vulnerable to depletion under dietary conditions that supply inadequate (n-3) PUFAs, that this effect is augmented by the physiological demands of pregnancy and lactation, and that maternal diet and parity interact to affect maternal brain PUFA status.}",
